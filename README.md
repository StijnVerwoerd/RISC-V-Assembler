### Instructions

Create a .txt a file and fill it with instructions in the style as shown below

```t
ADD x4, x6, x8            # Comments can be placed anywhere after a '#'
SW x4, 24(x28)     
label:
blt x2, x3, 24

# or like this 
ADDI x5, x5, 345

BEQ x3, x4, label:
```

The converter will interprete the above .txt input as follows

```t
ADD x4, x6, x8
SW x4, 24(x28)
blt x2, x3, 24               
ADDI x5, x5, 345
BEQ x3, x4, -8
```

Do note, labels can be up to 20 characters long and are case sensitive. 

Currently error handling is less than ideal but I intend to patch that soon. This means that you might encounter a segmentation fault when trying to convert something that can't be converted.
